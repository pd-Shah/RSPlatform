To install and use `ReactJS` , we need two things: `Node.js` and `NPM`
`Node.js` is a JavaScript runtime enviroment  that allow us to execute javascript code like we were working on a server.
`NPM` is a package manager for javascript that allo us to install javascript libraries.

 ```bash
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

```bash 
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
```

now install React by typing:


```bash 
sudo npm install -g create-react-app
```

```React
create-react-app app_name
```
